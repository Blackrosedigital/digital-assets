- Typography
  Used a website called [Fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/) to select a font pairing that i thought would work for the site. I chose Montserrat and Poppins as they are easily readible and modern.
  - [Monserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat)
  - [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=Poppins)

- Images
  sourced from royalty free site Unsplash. Images were then converted using [iloveimg](https://www.iloveimg.com/) for resizing images. and resized to reduce file sizes and in turn loading times.

- The Logo was designed by my grapgic designer who also created the brand styling.
